# VC.ai
A video conferencing experience smoothened by Machine Learning  
The project will be divided into multiple phases. Depending on how far we can reach, we will have the following completed  
* P0: Create a peer to peer video calling solution, based on webRTC or better
* P1: introduce machine learning based solutions for audio (and possibly video) quality
* P2: Focus on the overall experience, create a better UI, bundle it with text chat, try to make it multi participant.
* P3: Use ML to make the experience even smoother with smart suggestions, Audio detection, custom backgrounds.  
  
And, always open to suggestions
